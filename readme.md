# Basic JavaScript App to demo Mona
This repo is used as a demo for a _very basic_ HTML web application that MONA redirects to.

It implements two pages
 - /purchase 
 - /config
that show how to get some of the query string parametaers passed through by the MONA app. 

This app is intended to be deployed to an azure static web app
