# Basic JavaScript App to demo Mona
This repo is used as a starter for a _very basic_ HTML web application using no front-end frameworks.

It implements two pages
 - /purchase 
 - /config

that show how to get some of the query string parametaers passed through by the MONA app. 

This repo has a dev container. This means if you open it inside a [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces), or using [VS Code with the remote containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers), it will be opened inside a container with all the dependencies already installed.
